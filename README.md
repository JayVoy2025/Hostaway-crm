## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "npm: command not found"
**Solution:** Node.js is not installed

- Restart your terminal

### Problem: "Cannot connect to MongoDB"
**Solution:** MongoDB is not running
- **Mac:** `brew services start mongodb-community`
- **Windows:** Open Services, start MongoDB
- **Or:** Use MongoDB Atlas (cloud, free)

### Problem: "Port 3000 is already in use"
**Solution:** Another app is using that port
- Change the port in `.env`: `PORT=3001`
- Or find what's using port 3000: `lsof -i :3000` (Mac)

### Problem: Can't access from phone
**Solution:** Need same WiFi network
- Make sure phone and computer on same WiFi
- Find your computer's IP: `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac)
- On phone, go to: `http://YOUR_IP:3000`

### Problem: App looks broken on phone
**Solution:** Clear browser cache
- iPhone Safari: Settings → Safari → Clear History
- Or try private/incognito mode

### Problem: Lost data after restart
**Solution:** Database not persistent
- Make sure MongoDB is properly installed
- Check connection string in `.env`
- Or use MongoDB Atlas for persistence
